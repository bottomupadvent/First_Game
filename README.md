# First_Game_3D

- A 3D Isometric view game using **Godot game engine**, Models created using **MagicaVoxel** and rigged and animated using **Adobe's Mixamo**.
- This project is manifested after its prototype in **Arcade game library** in python which can be found in [First_Game_2D_Prototype](https://github.com/bottomupadvent/First_Game_2D_Prototype/tree/master) repository.
- **Idea/Concept**: For individuals who have experienced getting on a running train that has just set in motion from the platform in India or in my case trains running on the Western Railways will find resonance. 
The idea is to navigate through the rush on railway platform to get on the moving train.
